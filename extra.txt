                  Prairie Realty Advisors, Inc. ("PRA" or the "Company") is a
                  regional real estate financial services firm specializing in
                  origination and servicing of commercial mortgages and income
                  producing property. PRA was formed in September of 1992 to
                  operate as an efficient intermediary providing access to real
                  estate capital as well as a broad range of advisory services
                  to medium sized institutional real estate investors. To date
                  PRA has arranged over $3.0 billion in mortgage transactions.
                </p>
                <p className="opacity-80 text-center">
                  As a mortgage banker, PRA originates, sells and services
                  commercial real estate loans. In return for providing these
                  services, the Company receives remuneration in the form of
                  fees from borrowers or clients for originating the
                  transaction, and servicing override fees for "servicing" loans
                  for a lender. PRA has relationships with many institutional
                  lenders throughout the U.S. The firm is able to provide
                  capital to borrowers for loans ranging from $2,000,000 and
                  above.
                </p>
                <p className="opacity-80 text-center">
                  Headquartered in Chicago, the firm services a direct market of
                  over 15 million people. PRA takes special pride in the fact
                  that it is employed by its clients across geographic
                  boundaries. It works hard to create a bond between lender and
                  borrower in an attempt to realizing a higher percentage of
                  repeat business.
                </p>
                <p className="opacity-80 text-center">
                  As of January 2014, the firm has four employees. Loan
                  production and firm administration are the responsibility of
                  John F. Siff, President. Mr. Alby Van Alyea, Managing
                  Director, is primarily responsible for origination of loan
                  opportunities and production and reports to Mr. Siff. Loan
                  underwriting, administration, closing and servicing are under
                  the purview of Mr. Sandy Payne, Vice President. In order to
                  oversee the servicing portfolio, management has prudently
                  employed additional staff reporting to Payne.

                <p className="opacity-80 text-center">
                  Ms. Rosemarie Kern came on board in 1998 to oversee day to day
                  operation of the servicing company. With over 20 years of
                  accounting and servicing experience, Ms. Kern oversees all
                  Investor reporting, the Annual Audit and year-end reporting
                  functions as well.
